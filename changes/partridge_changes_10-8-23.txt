overhauled the ai's pathing, it now uses a NavigationAgent2D to follow Vector2 coords.
	note: this is what the pathfinding scene is for

added the astronomer and werewolf nodes to a "Player" group, this makes referencing them much easier

changed lines 23 and 30 in "Lever.gd" to reference the current player node using its group

added two variables too "EnemyRayCast2D.gd": "path" and "navAgent"
	note: navAgent might not do anything but I'm tired and don't feel like going and finding out at the moment so it's going to stay there for a bit

added line 18 in "EnemyRayCast2D.gd" to change the direction the raycast was facing based on the direction the ai is moving

added line 23 in "EnemyRayCast2D.gd" to set the target to the player

gave the enemy node an Area2D that detects if the player is close to the ai, this is the kill zone

added four variables too "Enemy.gd": "path", "killArea", "patrolPoints", and "tempPoints"
	note: "path" and "killArea" simply store a reference to their rotssssspective nodes, and the other two are Arrays that keep track of the patrol points.
		double note: "patrolPoints", is never altered as it is used for "tempPoints" to reference
